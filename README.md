Distribution of Player Position From the above pie chart we can colclude that the number of Defenders, Midfielders and Forwards are balanced. The relatively low percentage of goalkeepers (7.9%) reflects the league's convention of typically having only one goalkeeper on the field at a time, limiting the need for multiple goalkeepers in a squad. The higher proportion of defenders (35.1%) emphasizes the importance of a strong defense in a league where goals are at a premium, and teams often prioritize maintaining a solid backline. The presence of a substantial number of midfielders (29.4%) indicates the central role of this position in orchestrating the flow of the game, both in attack and defense. The percentage of forwards (27.6%) suggests a significant focus on scoring goals, with teams aiming to secure their victories by having a variety of attacking options.
