The distribution of player positions shows a balanced representation of Defenders, Midfielders, and Forwards. Notable observations include:
- **Goalkeepers (7.9%)**: The low percentage aligns with the league's practice of fielding only one goalkeeper per match.
- **Defenders (35.1%)**: Indicates a strong focus on defense, essential in a highly competitive league.
- **Midfielders (29.4%)**: Highlights the pivotal role of midfielders in controlling game flow.
- **Forwards (27.6%)**: Reflects the importance of scoring and the variety of attacking options used by teams.
